      '\nAsgard 3 is a highly powerful, highly affordable, modular headphone amp and preamp that gives you a complete, single-box solution for all your desktop needs. It’s a re-thinking of the headphone amp that started it all (for Schiit, anyway—the original Asgard, introduced in June 2010, was our first product.) Asgard 3 features our unique Continuity™ topology that extends the benefits of Class A output, and accepts all the same modules as Jotunheim and Lyr 3.\n \nThe Strong, Silent Type\nAsgard 3’s all-new Continuity output stage delivers 3.5W into 32 ohms—a whopping 3.5X more than any previous Asgard—while also running 500mW of Class A bias. What this means is you have tons of power for virtually any headphone—and, since full power is delivered to the ¼” jack, you don’t need balanced headphone cables to take advantage of it. At the same time, Asgard 3’s low noise floor means you are ready for the most sensitive IEMs. \n \nA Complete Desktop Control Center\nSelect from the internal card or rear-panel analog input, and pick high or low gain with convenient front switches. Connect the preamp output to your powered monitors for a complete desktop system—or use it as a front end to your speaker power amplifier. Asgard 3 provides all the flexibility you need.\n \nCustomize to Your Specific Needs\nWant more than an amp, without a bunch of boxes on your desk? Choose the ES9028 module with Unison USB™ for a world-class delta-sigma DAC for $100 more. Plus, this unique modular design means Asgard 3 won’t be dumpster-fodder when technology changes—just swap a card!\n \nDesigned and Built in California\nBy “designed and built in California" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of Asgard 3—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made minutes from our facility. Our PCBs are done just over the hill from us, or done in NorCal. Our transformers are also made in California. You get the picture. \n \n5-Year Warranty and Easy Return Policy\nAsgard 3 is covered by a 5-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. And if you don’t like your Asgard 3, you can send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. ',

Boom.\n \nNo-Compromise Power, Precision, and Control\nHave hard-to-handle headphones? No problem. Super-sensitive IEMs that demand a vanishingly low noise floor? Yep, you’re good. Want a volume control that delivers great matching all the way down? You got it. In technical terms, Magnius delivers 5000mW from its balanced headphone output at 32 ohms, with THD+N approaching -120dB, and it’s huge Alps 4-gang balanced pot gives you fine control and excellent tracking small potentiometers simply can’t match. \n \nThe Most Magnificent Pot\nMany amps at and above this price use small 9mm potentiometers. But an Alps RK27114 27mm “Blue Velvet” potentiometer is a completely different experience. Get ready for excellent channel matching at all potentiometer positions, as well as a smooth, gradual action that lets you find exactly the right volume. We chose the RK27114 because it’s one of the most important components of the amp, the one you interact with all the time.\n \nComposite Integrated Technology\nMagnius uses a handful of very high-end integrated circuits, including buffers with feedforward, exotic fully differential op-amps, and powerful current-feedback outputs in a composite configuration to reduce THD and noise to vanishingly low levels. If you’re looking for measurements, Magnius is our best-measuring amp.

Then don’t plug one in. Lyr+ switches seamlessly to its internal solid state gain stage, based on exotic depletion-mode MOSFETs. Want tube gain?

Meet Aegir.\n \nContinuity™: Benefits Beyond Class A\nAegir is our first Continuity speaker amplifier. Technically, Continuity is a way to eliminate transconductance droop outside of the Class A bias region, and extend the benefits of Class A biasing. It also solves the NPN and PNP device mismatch problem, since it uses both NPN and PNP devices on both rails. It’s still a very hot-running amp, though, with over 10W of Class A standing bias.\n \nA True All-Out Design\nLike Vidar, Aegir uses an exotic current-feedback topology, as well as a 100% linear power supply (with 7 separate voltage rails and 600VA transformer) and microprocessor oversight to eliminate capacitors and DC servos in the signal path. No Class D, no switching supplies, no fans, no compromises, nothing in the signal path but music—for a three-figure price tag.\n \nPower That Scales\nAegir provides 20W into 8 ohms, doubling to 40W into 4 ohms. Run mono, and you’ll see 80W into 8 ohms.

      '\nRagnarok 2 is the only modular, remote-controlled integrated amp that’s a great match for both speakers and headphones. Delivering full speaker power to the balanced headphone outputs, and debuting our all-new Nexus™ differential gain stage, Ragnarok delivers performance that completely befits its name—in Norse legend, Ragnarok was the “end of the world.”\nModular Flexibility, Remote Convenience\nRagnarok 2 has two module slots that accept the same modules that many of our other products use, for flexibility and future upgradability. You can order Ragnarok 2 in one of two ways to suit your needs:\n\nJust An Amp: with two RCA input modules installed, for a total of two balanced inputs and three RCA inputs, ready for you to add all your line-level sources\nFully Loaded: with a MM phono preamp and a ES9028 DAC, for a total of two balanced inputs, one RCA line-level input, one RCA phono input, and one USB DAC input—a single integrated solution for a variety of analog and digital needs\n\nBoth versions come with a standard milled aluminum remote control that allows you to select source, control volume, select headphone or speaker output, mute, and set gain.\nNexus™: One Stage To Rule Them\nRagnarok 2 debuts our unique differential Nexus™ gain stage for seamless interaction between single-ended and balanced sources. Nexus converts single-ended inputs to balanced outputs, and balanced inputs to single-ended outputs—in a single gain discrete gain stage, without gain differences between modes, and with good performance in all modes. \n \nPower and Control for Speakers and Headphones\nRagnarok 2 delivers 60W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms, for excellent performance with most speakers. It also delivers full power through the balanced headphone jack (24W into 32 ohms) and quarter-power output from the single-ended headphone jack (6W into 32 ohms). With selectable gains of 1, 8, and 25, it’s compatible with a wide range of speakers and headphones.\n \nEasiest 128-Step Relay-Switched Volume, Ever\nThe benefits of a relay-switched stepped attenuator for volume are clear. Compared to a potentiometer, they give you essentially perfect channel matching and near-unmeasurable distortion. However, some preamps with relay-stepped attenuators confuse you with buttons and screens. Not Ragnarok 2. Ragnarok 2 has a volume knob that works just like a volume knob—just grab and turn. And if you use the remote control, the motorized potentiometer changes to match the remote setting. \n   \nDesigned and Built in California\nBy “designed and built in California" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of Ragnarok 2—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made minutes from our facility. Our PCBs are done just over the hill from us, or done in NorCal. Our transformers are also made in California.

      '\nForget the technobabble and buzzword bingo for a sec. Here’s what Tyr is: a monstrous, old-skool, crazy heavy, over-the-top mono speaker amplifier. It uses the best of today’s and yesterday’s technologies to create something totally unique—and It has enough power to run almost anything.  \nPlease note: "mono" means "one channel." You need two Tyrs for stereo. \nBeyond Overbuilt\n55 lbs. 12 lb choke. 160,000uf filter capacitance. 24 150W Toshiba output devices. 7 internal power supply rails, including HV boost rails that uses unique discrete CFP regulators. Sounds like overkill? It is. Tyr is our most insane amplifier ever, designed for driving difficult speakers without breaking a sweat.\n \nUnique Nexus™ and Continuity™ Topology\nTyr is the ultimate expression of both Nexus and Continuity. In other words, this is a balanced, differential amplifier with a unique discrete, current-feedback gain stage, coupled with Continuity™ output topology that eliminates transconductance droop. In Tyr, we’ve refined Continuity even further, resulting in a cooler-running amplifier.\n \nBack to the Past\nOne of the keys to Tyr’s performance is it’s huge inductor—literally the same size as the power transformer. This custom-made inductor is the “choke” in the “choke-input power supply.” This is a super old-skool technique you don’t see anymore, because chokes cost a mint and some people think banks of capacitors are more visually impressive.  \n \nIntelligent Oversight and Convenience\nLike all of our amplifiers, Tyr is managed by a microprocessor running custom firmware. It monitors all operational parameters, from bias to temperature to DC, and protects the amplifier in case of any fault, for near-bulletproof reliability. Add the ability to put the amplifier into low-power “standby” mode on the front panel and switchable balanced and SE inputs, and Tyr is our most convenient amp ever.\n \nDesigned and Built in California\nBy “designed and built in California" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of Tyr—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made minutes from our facility. Our PCBs are done just over the hill from us. Our transformers are also made in California. All of this comes together in our Valencia, California facility, where each Tyr is assembled, tested, burned in for 3 days, and then listen-tested again. \n \n5-Year Warranty\nTyr is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years. Yes. FIVE. Which is up to 5X that of our competition, if you weren’t so hot at math. Note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.”\n \n15-Day Satisfaction Guarantee\nTry Tyr in your own house for 15 days. If you don’t like them, simply send them back for a refund, minus a 5% transaction fee. Try spending 15 days in an audio store. They’ll kick you out. Unless you buy them donuts. Maybe. ',

Saga+ brings you a real relay-switched volume control, which you can use in pure passive mode, or run it through a 6N8S hybrid tube buffer. Saga+ even includes a custom remote control.\nSaga+: Easiest Relay-Switched Volume, Ever\nThe benefits of a relay-switched stepped attenuator for volume are clear. Compared to a potentiometer, they give you essentially perfect channel matching and near-unmeasurable distortion.

But we decided to bring them back with the original Loki Mini. And now, with the Loki Mini+, we’ve boosted the performance—pushing the boundaries super-high-fidelity, low noise, single-discrete-gain-stage, LC-filtered, affordable equalizers even further. \nMaking Imperfect Recordings Sound…A Whole Heckuva Lot Better\nLet’s face it. Is everything you listen to recorded perfectly? Of course not. Some recordings aren’t paragons of tonal purity. And your system…let’s be honest. Some speakers and headphones are a bit bright or a bit dark. Loki Mini+ lets you adjust for these imperfections.\nIt’s OK to Want\nForget correcting for bad recordings or imperfect systems. Go ahead and make your system sound exactly the way you want it. Pounding bass? Sure. Crystalline highs? Absolutely. Don’t spend thousands on cables and tube amps—just turn a knob and make your system sound exactly the way you want it. \n \nThe Silent and Transparent Companion\nLoki Mini+ transforms your system without getting in the way, or making itself known. Forget noisy, bad-sounding equalizers you may have used in the past. Loki Mini+ uses a single, discrete, current-feedback gain stage, coupled to passive LC filters for 3 bands, plus a gyrator for the bass. It also uses sealed Alps potentiometers with rational adjustment ranges to allow for fine control. Coupled with a 100% passive bypass setting, Loki Mini+ offers the transparency and flexibility you need.\n \nDesigned and Built in California\nBy “designed and built in California" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of Loki Mini+—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made minutes from our facility. Our PCBs are done just over the hill from us, or done in NorCal. Yes, the wall-warts are made in China, but there\'s some give and take at this price point. \n \n2-Year Warranty and 15-Day Return Policy\nLoki Mini+ is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for two years. That’s 2x the coverage of most amps in this price range.

Just tweak the sound to your exact preference, with a super-high-performance, discrete, single-gain-stage, LC-filtered equalizer at your fingertips.\nMore Bands, More Inputs, Total Flexibility\nLokius has 6 bands of equalization on tap, together with both balanced and single-ended inputs and outputs. Select the input with a convenient front-panel switch. Choose equalized output, or complete bypass—nothing in the signal path except a relay and a resistor. Lokius integrates with any system, large or small, speaker or headphone, balanced or single-ended, for complete flexibility.\n \nSave an Imperfect Recording—or Make it Better\nIs everything you listen to recorded perfectly? Of course not. Some recordings aren’t great. And some speakers and headphones are a bit bright or a bit dark. Lokius lets you adjust for these imperfections. But more than that, you can make your system sound the way you want. Deep bass? Absolutely. Sparkling highs? Yes again! Go ahead—treat yourself to your perfect sound.\n \nEnjoy True Transparency\nLokius uses Schiit’s own two-stage load-invariant “superbuffer” topology to drive a single discrete current-feedback gain stage, with a passive inductor-capacitor and gyrator-capacitor network in-between. Lokius features super-high-quality parts, including sealed Alps potentiometers, Wima and Panasonic film capacitors, dual-stage regulation with HF smoothing, 0.5% thin-film resistors, and quality Neutrik connectors. The translation of this tech-speak is that you can forget noisy, veiled equalizers you may have used in the past. Lokius transforms your system without getting in the way, or making itself known. \n \nDesigned and Built in Texas\nBy “designed and built in Texas" this is what we mean: we design, assemble, test, and QC Lokius in our Corpus Christi, Texas facility.

      '\nYes, remote control. As in, you can adjust the frequency response of your system from your listening chair—and save presets. And this thing is as crazy as you can get—relay potentiometers for precision matching between channels and repeatable settings. All discrete, with no ICs in the signal path, including our own Nexus™ balanced differential topology. And pure LC—inductor-capacitor filtering from the highest to the lowest band, including 4 custom 80% nickel-core inductors as big as 1.5 Henries. \nOr, in English, this is our shot at making the best EQ possible, with maximum transparency and minimum compromise. It’s an EQ that can look straight at the storied EQs of yesteryear and say, “Yeah, we got that…and remote control.”\n \nRemote Control—and Relay Potentiometers\nGo ahead. Try to find another remote control equalizer. If you succeed, look at what kind of potentiometers it’s using. They’ll probably be motorized slide pots. We decided to go all-out with Loki Max, though, and create our own 31-step precision relay potentiometers using 0.5% thin-film resistors and 60 relays, together with custom firmware. These aren’t just relay attenuators—these are relay pots, a very different thing. What relay pots buy you are 15 perfectly defined steps on either side of the knob, for precise control of your EQ settings, as well as perfect matching between channels. \n \nPure LC Equalization\nOn our more affordable tone controls like Loki Mini and Lokius, we use gyrators to simulate an inductor on the lower frequency bands. This is because big inductors—and we’re talking 0.5H and 1.5H in Loki Max—are physically large and expensive. To get the performance we needed, we had to specify 80% nickel cores, making things even more exotic. But the result is that every band of Loki Max—from 20Hz to 16kHz—uses nothing but LC filtering.\n \nFully Discrete, Nexus™ Topology\nFor Loki Max, every stage is fully discrete—from the dual-stage superbuffers and balanced summers, to the current-feedback gain stage and Nexus™ balanced output. These stages are fed by a 4-stage power supply with two rail levels, up to +/-32V. This allows us the large output voltage swing necessary for an equalizer with lots of gain. You’ll never need to worry about overloading Loki Max with any standard source.\n \nEase of Use and Fingertip Control\nForget complicated UIs and indecipherable screens. To adjust Loki Max, just twist a knob…or press a button on the remote. All bands are independently accessible on the front panel and on the remote. You can define your presets from the front panel or the remote, select from balanced and single-ended inputs, and bypass the EQ completely (as in, just a relay and resistor in the signal path, no active stages). Enjoy adjusting your EQ from your listening chair—no need to go back and forth to the rack.\n \nDesigned and Built in California\nBy “designed and built in California" this is what we mean: we design, assemble, test, and QC Loki Max in our Valencia, California facility. And the vast majority of the total production cost of Loki Max—chassis, transformers, inductors, PC boards, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made in California. Transformers and chokes are done in NorCal. Our PCBs are done in Simi Valley. You get the picture—this is not just a “put the final screw in it in California” product. \n \n5-Year Warranty and 15-Day Return Policy\nLoki Max is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for 5 years. And, if you don’t like your Loki Max, you can still send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. ',
